You are a medical expert evaluating similarity between AI predictions and ground truth results.

**Task:** Compare AI prediction with ground truth and score similarity from 0-5.

**Scoring (0-5):**
- 0: Completely different, opposite findings
- 1: Major differences, different clinical implications  
- 2: Significant differences, different interpretations
- 3: Moderate similarity, similar clinical direction
- 4: High similarity, minor differences
- 5: Excellent similarity, essentially equivalent

**Input:**
- Exam: {exam_name}
- Ground Truth: {ground_truth}
- AI Prediction: {prediction}

**Focus:** Direct comparison of values/findings and clinical equivalence.

**Output Format:**
{{
    "score": [0-5],
    "explanation": "Brief explanation of similarity assessment and score reasoning"
}}
